### What NPM stands for?
NPM stands for "Node Package Manager". It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language, primarily used for managing dependencies of Node.js applications. NPM allows developers to easily install, manage, and share packages of code that can be used in their projects. It is one of the most popular package managers in the JavaScript ecosystem.

### What is scope in JavaScript? 
JavaScript scope refers to the accessibility and visibility of variables and functions within a specific portion of a program. There are two types of scope: global, which means variables and functions can be accessed from anywhere in the program, and local, which means they can only be accessed within a particular function or block. JavaScript uses lexical scoping to determine the scope of a variable based on its position in the code. This affects how variables are accessed and manipulated in a program, making it essential to understand scope for writing efficient and maintainable code.

### What is Strict Mode?
Strict Mode is a feature introduced in ECMAScript 5 for JavaScript that enforces a stricter set of rules for writing JavaScript code. It helps prevent common programming mistakes, making code more secure and reliable. Some key features of Strict Mode include disallowing the use of undeclared variables, requiring unique property names in objects, preventing duplicate function parameters, disallowing the deletion of certain variables or function names, and preventing the use of eval or arguments as variable names. To enable Strict Mode, add the string literal 'use strict' at the beginning of a JavaScript file or function. When enabled, it will throw errors for any violations of the rules, making it easier to identify and fix potential issues.
